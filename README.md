# Arwing

I learned to code over the course of working on this project.  For that reason, there are some software engineering choices that I would have made differently if I started from scratch today.

The project is old and never-ending, and I soon plan on migraiting away from Arduino and rebuilding the entier code on my own microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE.
